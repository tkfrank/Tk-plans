<h1>Future plans</h1>
<p>A college I would like to attend would be Harvard university. The main reason I wish to attend is because I want to become a doctor and also study law. Becoming a doctor is my dream job because it would allow me to help people which is my greatest concern. Law courses would also be something I would like to do in order to understand my rights. This would be the reason I would like to attend Harvard and make use of their resources.
