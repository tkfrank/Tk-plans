<h1> buisness</h1>
<p>   If i were to start a business it would be similar to amazon. I would like to allow people to buy and sell items through my business. Also being able to sell items at a more affordable price for everyone so then no one truly loses much money while i'm still able to gain profit. This would allow me to slowly create a better economy for everyone</p>
